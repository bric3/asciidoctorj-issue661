This project's goal was demonstrating the issue https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj/issues/661.
But it seems the project was mis-configured (inspired by https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-examples/issues/15), very poor and outdated gradle example.

The solution is to place the dependency in the asciidoctor configuration not in the classpath.


```
buildscript {
    repositories { jcenter() }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.asciidoctor:asciidoctor-gradle-plugin:1.5.7'
    }
}

ext {
    springRestDocs = '1.2.4.RELEASE'
    asciidoctorj = '1.5.9'
}

apply plugin: 'org.asciidoctor.convert'

dependencies {
    asciidoctor "org.springframework.restdocs:spring-restdocs-asciidoctor:$springRestDocs"
    asciidoctor "org.asciidoctor:asciidoctorj-diagram:$asciidoctorj"
}

//...
```
